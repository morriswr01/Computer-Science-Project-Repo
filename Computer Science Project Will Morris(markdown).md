## Analysis
+ Describe the problem
   - **A bank has a base of customers** all of which have single or multiple, savings or general accounts that they use to store and manage their money. The data for all of these accounts and customers are currently stored in paper form, this is done via a paper form for each customer which contains their personal details such as name, age, email, DOB etc. These forms are stored in individual "folders" and are identified by their fore/surname which are stored in cabinets in a massive file room in alphabetical order and for example a cabinet would represent surnames with initial A-C.

   If a customer wants to open an account with the bank a form must be filled out stating the details of it, such as: the customers full name so that the new account is linked to an individual; the type of account(savings, investment ISA etc); date that it was opened etc. This is then stored ideally with the customers "root" form so that it can always be identified. The customers personal form will also have a list or field for accounts so that it can be identified that he/she has x number of accounts and they are listed by the name that the customer gave that account when they opened it for example "Retirement Fund".

   An accounts balance is stored on a server database which can only be accessed by the bank and various credit card machines where a user might use a card to by something in which case the card uses the name and account number to access the banks database and request funds. At this point a transaction is logged if the transaction is successful. However the customer can only review this transaction(s) either at the end of the month when a paper statement is sent out for each account that the customer posesses showing the transactions for that month. The customer can also go into the nearest branch in person to request the same paper copy to be printed off to show an up-to date balance and
